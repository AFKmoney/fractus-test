"""CognitiveModes: Kuramoto phases as a detector of mental state.

THE INNOVATION. The Kuramoto oscillators aren't just a routing mechanism —
they're a DYNAMICAL SYSTEM whose phase pattern reflects the current "cognitive
mode" of the engine. This module:

    1. Extracts features from the phase vector (synchronization, clustering).
    2. Clusters phase patterns into cognitive modes (UNSUPERVISED — the modes
       emerge from the data, not from external labels).
    3. Lets the engine ADAPT its behavior based on its current mode.

This is what makes Fractus feel ALIVE — it has mental states that change how
it processes information, like a human shifting between focused work and
creative brainstorming.

UNSUPERVISED APPROACH (replaces the original supervised MLP):
    Instead of labelling phases with mode names (which is arbitrary), we collect
    phase features during a training run and cluster them with k-means. The
    clusters that emerge ARE the cognitive modes — defined by their centroids
    in the (synchronization, mean_phase, variance, sin/cos) feature space. Mode
    names are assigned a posteriori by interpreting the cluster characteristics
    (high sync = "focused", low sync = "exploratory", etc.).

Usage:
    modes = CognitiveModes(n_oscillators=8, n_modes=4)
    # Collect phases during training, then fit:
    modes.fit(phase_samples)  # phase_samples: (N_samples, n_oscillators)
    # Classify at runtime:
    mode = modes.classify(phases)  # → {"mode": "cluster_0", "confidence": 0.82, ...}
