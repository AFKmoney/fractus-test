"""PersistentMemory: long-term memory that survives across sessions.

THE INNOVATION. Claude and GPT forget everything between conversations.
This module gives the Continuous Thought Engine TRUE long-term memory:

    - A bank of "memory vectors" (d_model dimensional) stored on disk.
    - At startup, the engine loads its memories and injects them into the
      thought state — it "remembers" past interactions.
    - During operation, salient thoughts are periodically written back to
      the memory bank — the engine "learns" from experience.
    - Memories are keyed by context (what was happening when the memory
      formed), enabling associative recall.

This is the module that makes Fractus PERSONAL — it adapts to the user,
remembers preferences, and accumulates knowledge over time. No datacenter
needed; the memory lives on the user's machine.

Usage:
    memory = PersistentMemory(d_model=128, path="~/.fractus/memory.pt")
    engine.reset_thought()
    engine.inject_memory(memory)  # remember past context
    # ... think ...
    memory.consolidate(engine.thought_state, context="user asked about sorting")
    memory.save()
